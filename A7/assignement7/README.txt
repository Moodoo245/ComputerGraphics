# Introduction to CS-341 Computer Graphics
GROUP: 24

## Assignment 7:

Using the Computer Graphics course theory slides here is how we solved each following problem:

#### Shadowmap
Calculate the norm of the vector

#### Phong shadow
We modify the assignement 6 code so that it doesn't do the ambient and does the specular and diffused only if it is not obstructed i.e. 
the length from the light source to the vertex is shorter than the value in the shadowmap. Not forgetting to multiply so that we don't have 
any shadow acne.
